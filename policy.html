                    We will only collect and use personal information in line with our responsibilities under applicable
                    data protection laws. We may share your information with our Group companies, advisers, suppliers,

                </p>

                <h4>SHARING AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL DATA</h4>
                <p>We respect and are committed to protecting your privacy. We do not sell or otherwise provide personal
                    information to other companies for the marketing of their own products or services. We will retain

                    public importance.
                </p>

                <h4>DATA PROCESSING</h4>
                <p>Our processing of personal data will satisfy at least one of the following processing conditions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Consent. You have given consent to the processing for one or more specific purposes;</li>
                    <li>Necessary for the performance of a contract. The processing is necessary for the
                        performance of a contract with you or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering
                        into a contract. Where this ground applies the provision of the information is a contractual
                        requirement and if you fail to provide it we will be unable to provide the services that you
                        have requested;</li>
                    <li>Legal obligation. The processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to
                        which we are subject;</li>
                    <li>Vital interests. The processing is necessary in order to protect your or another personâ€™s
                        vital interests, e.g. in medical emergencies;</li>
                    <li>Public functions. The processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out
                        in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us;</li>
                    <li>Legitimate interests. The processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate
                        interests pursued by us or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by your
                        interests or fundamental rights and freedoms which require the protection of personal data.
                        Legitimate interests include the transfer of data for internal administrative purposes, market
                        research activities, direct marketing purposes, preventing fraud, ensuring network and
                        information security, and reporting criminal acts or threats to public security.</li>

                    knowingly collect Personal Data from individuals under the age of 18. If you have reason to believe
                    that an individual under the age of 18 has provided Personal Data to the Company through the Service
                    please contact us and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.</p>

                <h4>GDPR</h4>
                <p>Your rights as registered and your revocation of consent. The General Data Protection Regulation
                    guarantees you certain rights that you can assert over us. You have the right:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To request confirmation from us as to whether personal data about you is being processed
                        and, if so, the specific circumstances of data processing (Article 15 GDPR: right of
                        registration for the data subject);</li>
                    <li>To request that we immediately correct incorrect personal data about you In view of the
                        purpose of the processing, you also have the right to request the completion of incomplete
                        personal data, including through a supplementary declaration (Article 16 GDPR: right of
                        correction);</li>
                    <li>To request that we immediately delete personal data about you (Article 17 GDPR: the right
                        of deletion);</li>
                    <li>To request that we restrict processing (Article 18 GDPR: Right to restrict processing).
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Finally, if you have given us your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
                    In this case, all data processing performed by us up to the time you revoke your consent is still
                    legal. For this purpose, you can simply click on the link in each email and cancel the subscription
                    from the email service or send an email to support@wowcontents.com. Once you have revoked your
                    consent, we will no longer use the information you have provided for advertising purposes. We will
                    also not pass on your information to third parties for advertising purposes.
